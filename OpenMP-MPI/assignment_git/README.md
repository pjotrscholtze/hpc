# parallel-demo
Demonstration and practice code for a tutorial on the parallel
programming frameworks OpenMP and MPI.

## Hello world

File: hello.c
Simple 'Hello world' program to check that sequential compilation works.

## OpenMP

File: hello-omp.c
Simple 'Hello world' program with OpenMP multi-threading.

File: primes.c
Count the number of primes in a given range of integers (the range is hard-coded in the program).
As provided this is a sequential program, but add one or two OpenMP annotations to it, and you have
a parallel program!

## MPI
